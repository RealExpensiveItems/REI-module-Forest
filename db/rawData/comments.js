During cold weather, it got used just about every day.  It was surprisingly warm and insulated quite well even when it was wet.  I wore my rain coat over it several times to block the wind.  I used the jacket in 10 deg temps in the Smokey's and I stayed warm.  I abused the jacket about every way possible and it's still in good shape.  It got drug over rocks, thru trees and brush.  It got rained on and it didn't always get washed per the instructions.  There's not any rips or tears and while it doesn't look like a new jacket any more, I can't justify replacing it either.`},
{title:`great jacket but wears out`,author:`eliot`,stars:`4`,time:`2018-08-15`,helpful:`18`,unhelpful:`4`,comment:`These are great jackets but I have found that they wear out if not treated carefully. I'm on my third one, and I use it primarily for warmth in camp, when taking breaks hiking, etc. With the previous two, I made the mistake of treating them as jackets for everyday wear; over time, the quilting stitches started to go on both (cosmetic problem only, at least initially), and the zipper wore out on one. I tend to be hard on clothing, and I think making any jacket light and packable involves some compromises on durability. But this fits me better than any of the others that REI stocks (it's not super-slim, and neither am I) and it;s still a great jacket.`},

It’s light and keeps me warm here in oregon. My only complaint and concern is that for the price, I’ve had to return one already because the thread was pulling out and for a $200 dollar jacket that’s not something you expect, especially when I only wear it around town. I haven’t hiked or put this jacket through the ringer at all. I returned the first one and exchanged it for another one come to find out I found another thread pulling out. I’m torn because of the price of this jacket. I’m debating just returning it altogether and going with a different brand.`},
{title:`Close to perfection, but material is so thin.`,author:`DandyBoho`,stars:`4`,time:`2018-05-25`,helpful:`26`,unhelpful:`2`,comment:`So many minimalist bloggers and vloggers give this jacket such high praise. I don’t recall ever hearing a bad word about it. So, I decided to give it a try. It’s wonderful at keeping you warm, especially when layered. I work outdoors year-round, and have worn this jacket (with some extra layers) almost everyday this winter. No complaints there. My only complaint is that the shell material is so thin that it rips so easily, ending up with little tufts of white polyester poking out. Lightly brushing a broken twig put a hole in my arm. A dog jumping up to put its front paws on my waist led to a couple more. Etc. I would expect a bit better quality for the price. If the material was a little tougher it would be perfect.`},

While very thin and almost weightless, the jacket seems to have the ability to adapt to the temperature around you and make you forget you are wearing it.  Perfect for wearing under waders in cool to cold climates.  While in Alaska, noticed that 75%+ of the fishing guides have one (the hoodie version for fast boating).

I am 6’4” and I typically have issues with sleeve length. Not a problem with this jacket. It fits so nicely across the shoulders that the Large was great. I am a beanpole too, so the shaping and the cut was perfect too. I only had on a t-shirt under and I was plenty warm. So at 40 degrees I didn’t even have to layer up and then shed as we hit 50/55. We were on and off boats and I never was cold and never had an issue with the splash that we would get randomly from the waves. `},

Normally I run an Arc'teryx Atom LT Hoody, or an OR Ferrosi Hoody. This is in the similar price point and was hoping for a winner. Sadly, the zippers and seams around them are poorly put together, and the main front zipper is difficult to negotiate and zip up because the insert pin doesn't slip well into the zipper retaining box easily at all. In terms of feel on the skin, the outside and the inside of the jacket are lined with identical material, making the inside of the sleeves feel rough. Normally I might expect a microfiber fleece lining on parts of the inside of the jacket, or maybe just the pockets. No luck here. The fit is nice, not too slim, not too puffy, but the other negatives along with the current price don't justify the purchase. Will be returning.`},

The only one in store was a medium and I typically wear a large (I'm about 5'10 and 170 with a medium/athletic build for reference), but tried on the medium anyways. Overall the jacket fits great, definitely fits more like a large than a medium. I can still wear layers under it when needed, and to wear a layer over it (like a rain jacket) isn't bad either. My first time wearing it out in inclement weather (temps in the teens and strong winds) I was shocked how well it blocked the wind, and it's very warm, especially for not being very bulky. `},

It's more comfortable than the other jackets I tried out at REI at this price point. The Arcteryx and Patagonia parkas were the only ones that were as comfortable, but they're the in $400-500 price range.
The only downside is that you can tell they cut corners on the seams like velcro and zippers. They're cheaper but they'll still do the job. For the price, this is a good jacket.`},

So it's roomier than it seems. Wore it over a light hoodie for a snowy hike in 27 degrees this morning and I was perfectly comfortable.

It's warm and thin enough where you don't feel like a bulky snowman walking around. Love the fact that it has a high collar and a lining at the end of the zipper so it doesn't scratch your chin or neck. The 2 zip pockets and the hidden one inside are awesome.

{title:`Great jacket`,author:`WinterFun`,stars:`5`,time:`2019-01-09`,helpful:`3`,unhelpful:`0`,comment:`I'm 6' ft, 162 lbs with 34.5" arms and the Medium fits me very well. Good arm and torso length. Warmer than its light weight makes it seem and has swallowed up any layers I've tried underneath it, very comfortably. The 5 pockets are well-designed and the hand pockets are comfortable and easy to put things in. The hood is big and very adjustable. Grippy snowskirt and cinchable around the hips. Great activewear. I look forward to trying it for downhill and x-country skiing. It's been great so far around town and for cold weather hiking in New England.`},
{title:`Amazing`,author:`rubendel`,stars:`5`,time:`2018-03-21`,helpful:`10`,unhelpful:`0`,comment:`This jacket exceeded my expectations. skiied in single digits with only an R1 underneath and was comfortable. Doesn't get too hot when the temp goes up and is easy to dump heat of needed. perfect length. Hood is a little too small to cover a ski helmet. For the price, the insulated snowshot is tough to beat.`},
{title:`Excellent Jacket, High REI Price`,author:`Pickerandagrinner`,stars:`5`,time:`2018-12-31`,helpful:`4`,unhelpful:`4`,comment:`I just purchased this jacket.  In very cold weather an inner layer is needed for warmth.  It is very comfortable, the outer material is soft and stretches with body movements.  I bought the jacket in a Patagonia store for $279.  Save $50 and buy it there!`},
{title:`Poorly design`,author:`Peter`,stars:`2`,time:`2019-03-21`,helpful:`0`,unhelpful:`0`,comment:`As a winter coat, it is not very warm for winter in the upper midwest; also it has a non-detachable hood which, for me, gets in the way and is annoying. Shame on me for being an inattentive consumer.`},

{title:`How do they come up with this stuff?`,author:`Troubadour`,stars:`5`,time:`2018-11-02`,helpful:`10`,unhelpful:`0`,comment:`I love this jacket! It looks great but all the little details, man I’m impressed! One example is the Velcro on the back of the hood, wearing a ski helmet, there’s room but if you’re not it won’t come down to your nose, stuff like that..I don’t ski or do winter sports but I could see how it would be great. Fit is on the large side, I wear between a med and large, got the medium and there’s plenty of room without being too big. Got the graphite, matches my Thule camera backpack (with the blue accents) nicely I’ll not be home bound this winter. Very pleased, if you like it check it out.. very cool!`},
{title:`Lots of Pockets and Very Warm`,author:`ApacheBlue`,stars:`5`,time:`2017-02-11`,helpful:`33`,unhelpful:`0`,comment:`This jacket is the perfect all around jacket for cold weather. I wear some mid weight base layers and this jacket does the rest. Wicks away moisture without having that damp, clammy feeling. Lots of extras also. Sleeve cuffs to keep the cold and snow out; removable hood; drop down tail to keep the wind, snow and cold off your lower back. Just a Great jacket for the price.`},
{title:`Solid and Versatile Jacket`,author:`damianwa`,stars:`5`,time:`2017-12-06`,helpful:`26`,unhelpful:`0`,comment:`I was looking for a versatile jacket for snow, rain, and casual wear and dislike the 3-1 jackets that are all the rage right now. Found this jacket, last of its model at my local REI in my size nonetheless, tried it on, and was immediately sold. The jacket keeps you warm without feeling like a sauna (one of my favorite qualities of this jacket since I tend to run warm) while eliminating excess bulkiness. The thermal reflective lining serves its purpose and is well placed along the inside of the jacket to maintain your core temp. Another great quality of this jacket is that it has plenty of pockets - fleece lined pockets for your hands, chest pocket, (secret) inner lining pocket, and an extra pocket for snow goggles, or anything else. Also, the outer Omni-Tech material is structured, which is great, without being stiff or inhibiting mobility. I usually purchase TNF products, but this one's definitely a winner.`},
{title:`Outstanding!!! Warm, Waterproof, Not Bulky!!`,author:`SAngevine`,stars:`5`,time:`2017-01-10`,helpful:`15`,unhelpful:`1`,comment:`I cannot be happier with this jacket. We've had some single digit temperatures recently and this jacket performed flawlessly. The hood is detachable (a plus for me) but even with the hood on - you can set it for covering your head OR for covering your head while you are wearing a helmet - great design. It even has a snap cinch for your waist that is intuitive and easy to use when needed.`},

{title:`The color of the product when received is GREEN`,author:`Patagonia Fjord jacket`,stars:`1`,time:`2018-01-02`,helpful:`9`,unhelpful:`44`,comment:`The fabric is 'Forest Green' heather, dark but not Carbon as what most would expect, maybe carbon can be green but I would not expect to receive a green fabric from what is shown on the website. The arms are narrow for an extra large, I would consider the body 'slim fit', nearly a size small, I am 6'4, 205 with medium arms.`},

{title:`This needs a review....great jacket`,author:`Smacky`,stars:`5`,time:`2018-10-25`,helpful:`6`,unhelpful:`0`,comment:`I got this last minute for a trip to northern montana to replace a lighter montbell "puffy" that didnt have the ruggedness this does.  Had consistent temps from single digits to 20s daily for weeks in the mountains, also with snow and being exposee for days in high winds. I never had to break out my hard shell one single time.  This is both water and wind proof and was not compromised. Nice rugged materials, super warm and worth the money.`},

Warm , water proof ,  fits perfect it’s been dumping snow here in yosemite and this jacket has kept me dry and warm . Packs decently small for how warm it keeps you worth the money bought it in October so far so good`},
{title:`Great all around coat`,author:`Sean`,stars:`4`,time:`2019-01-07`,helpful:`1`,unhelpful:`0`,comment:`I purchased this because I wanted a lightweight coat that looks nice and, most importantly, didn't make me feel like I was in a cocoon.  It is really warm with proper under layer, especially if you are moving around.  It might not be the best for standing around in below freezing weather, but that is not what it is designed for.  I really like that I can sit in my car with it on and feel like I have total freedom of movement.  I wore it in the rain for the first time the other day and it was perfectly waterproof.  Overall, I am very happy with the coat.`}
